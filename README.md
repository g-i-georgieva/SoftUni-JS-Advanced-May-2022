The JavaScript Advanced course extends the skills gained in the JavaScript Fundamentals course with more sophisticated concepts and principles of Functional Programming (FP) and Object-Oriented Programming (PLO) with JavaScript, as well as using DOM to process elements in a web page. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (modern JavaScript is studied with ES2017).

The course starts by studying the JavaScript object object (DOM and BOM) and interacting with it from JavaScript: searching, editing and deleting DOM tree elements, event processing, interaction with the web browser.

In-depth study of functions and paradigms from functional programming (FP): function as object, functional expressions, higher order functions, IIFE, JS object and JSON operation, object composition, higher order functions, closure, JS templates such as revealing module, prototype object inheritance and prototype chain, work with generators and iterators.
